## Computer Vision - Assignment 1


### Requirements

The required libraries can be found in the `requirements.txt` file.

### Running the project

In order to run the project, you have to run the `run.py` script. The expected 
arguments are the task number, the input directory, and the output directory. For
the third task another two arguments are required: the path to the template cube 
image and the path to the directory containing one example for each of the nine 
digits (the digits database). This directory is already added to the repo and has
been generated by running the `generate_digit_db.py` script.

```
$ python run.py --help

usage: run.py [-h] [--template-path TEMPLATE_PATH] [--digit-db-path DIGIT_DB_PATH] [--debug] task input_dir output_dir

positional arguments:
  task                  which task to solve (1, 2 or 3)
  input_dir             path to the directory containing the input images
  output_dir            directory path for where to store the generated outputs (directory must exist)

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --template-path TEMPLATE_PATH
                        path to the sudoku cube template (required for task 3)
  --digit-db-path DIGIT_DB_PATH
                        path to the directory containing the 9 digit templates (required for task 3)
  --debug               display plots of intermediary steps, for debugging
```

Examples of usage for each task:

```
$ python run.py 1 ./evaluation/fake_test/classic/ ./evaluation/submission_files/dummy_submission/classic/

$ python run.py 2 ./evaluation/fake_test/jigsaw/ ./evaluation/submission_files/dummy_submission/jigsaw/

$ python run.py 3 ./evaluation/fake_test/cube/ ./evaluation/submission_files/dummy_submission/cube/ --template-path ./template.jpg --digit-db-path ./digit_db/
```
